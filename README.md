# Puppies vs Kittens

Probably the most ridiculous thing I've made... 

A React / Redux web app to make puppies and kittens fight each other. This was refactored from an old, pure React, project to use Redux and Styled Components as practice.

## Setup

- run `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Head to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
